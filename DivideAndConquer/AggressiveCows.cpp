// Farmer John has built a new long barn, with N (2 <= N <= 100,000) stalls.
// The stalls are located along a straight line at positions x1,â€¦,xN 
// (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000).
// His C (2 <= C <= N) cows don't like this barn layout and become aggressive 
// towards each other once put into a stall. To prevent the cows from hurting 
// each other, FJ wants to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum
// distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the 
//largest minimum distance?
